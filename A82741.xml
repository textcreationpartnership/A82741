            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe ſignal Mercies wherewith God hath bleſſed this Commonwealth for ſome years paſt, are ſo evident and convincing, that ſuch onely who are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the hand from whence they come, can refuſe to make acknowledgement. And had not the Concerns been more then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, which were Imbarkt with the late Adventures in theſe Nations, their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage might have been according to the expectance of the Adverſary: But though not for our ſakes, yet for his great Name
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169323:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 57 -->ſake, who ſits in Heaven and laughs to ſcorn all the Plots and Devices of the ungodly, hitherto we have been delivered. <hi>The ſnare is broken, and we are eſcaped.</hi> 'Tis not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known with what an outſtretched Arm it hath pleaſed God, as well to prevent, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel thoſe dangers which ſeemed of late to threaten this Nations Peace, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie of ſome from their former Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in conjunction with old Enemies, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a neutral Generation, in ſo much as few Counties of <hi>England</hi> but have been in ſome meaſure infeſted, though not with open acts of Hoſtility, yet with ſecret Complottings and Attempts, to debauch the people to an Inſurrection, but more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the North-Weſtern parts, where Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> Colonel <hi>Egerton,</hi> Colonel <hi>Werden,</hi> and ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al others their Accomplites, upon pretence of adding to this Nations Freedom, would have by force of Arms, brought it into Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, by re-admitting a Kingly Intereſt and Family, againſt which God hath ſo long by a Succeſſive and uninterrupted Series of Providences very fully witneſſed; That when in many other places of this Nation, even at once the Enemy hath attempted to break in upon our peace like a flood, 'tis won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to behold, how the Spirit of the Lord hath lifted up a Standard againſt him. All which the Parliament conſidering, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckoned it a duty incumbent on them to ſet apart <hi>Thurſday</hi> next, being the ſixth day of <hi>October,</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred fifty nine, for a Day of ſolemn Praiſes and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169323:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 57 -->to be returned unto the Lord; And to the end, that all who are truly free to ſuch a Duty, within the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and late lines of Communication, may have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to offer a Sacrifice of Praiſe on this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, the Parliament doth hereby De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare they are invited thereunto; and as for all other parts of this Commonwealth, upon the third day of <hi>November</hi> next: That as the true performance of this Duty is by ſuch a people as are made free in the Sons freedom (for <hi>Praiſe waiteth for God in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) ſo an occaſion is hereby given to render it to the Lord, even in the Great Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>And although this Combination was ſo general, its appearance ſuddain, and there was not wanting a readineſs of willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to offer themſelves in ſuch a day of tryal; yet that it hath pleaſed God, with the loſs of ſo little Blood, to ſtill the raging enemy and avenger, yea, after his defeat and diſappointment, that both Perſons and Things are brought to light in this matter beyond expectation, are none of the leaſt motives to quicken and excite even all that fear God, and work righteouſneſs in theſe Nations, unto ſuch a Duty at this Seaſon, not doubting but as it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to cauſe <hi>the wrath of man to praiſe him,</hi> ſo that the <hi>remainder of wrath will he reſtrain.</hi>
